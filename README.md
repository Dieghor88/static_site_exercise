## <div align="center">Reproducing a homepage with HTML/CSS+Bootstrap. An exercise from the course I´m taking. </div>  
  

- I am learning HTML/CSS through the "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" course.   
  

- It´s the first time that I´m using Bootstrap.   
  

- It´s a good way for me to learn how to use and edit the Bootstrap template components. 
  

- I now plan to reproduce this site again, but without Bootstrpt, as a challenge.
